# Statistical-Learning-Semester-Project

Semester Project for Statistical Learning at the University of Iowa

## Introduction

This datasets is related to red variants of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine. Physicochemical (inputs) and sensory (the output) variables are available.
The datasets can be viewed as classification or regression tasks.

## Data

Source: https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/red-wine-quality-cortez-et-al-2009

Features:
- fixed acidity
- volatile acidity
- citric acid
- residual sugar
- chlorides
- free sulfur dioxide
- total sulfur dioxide
- density
- pH
- sulphates
- alcohol

Output variable (based on sensory data):
- quality (score between 0 and 10)


## Objective

Use machine learning to determine which physiochemical properties make a wine 'good'!
